There are controversial political implications about the nature of Rusyn as a language or dialect.
Some linguists treat it as a distinct language (with its own ISO 639-3 code), whereas some Ukrainian scholars of Slavic languages treat it as a dialect of Ukrainian.
<some translators translate it to Russian. I didn't make a seperate class for Russian Language >
Note: East Russian Language (http://sh.dbpedia.org/resource/Istočnorusinski_jezik) is actually referring to Ruthenian. So I merged it to Ruthenian.

A lot disambiguition pages
'Function' can be so general as linguistically confusing.
