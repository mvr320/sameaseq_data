mathematical_function = mathematical function
function_disambiguition =
propositional_function =
real_function = real-valued function.
value = value of a function or the output of a function
value_disambiguition = the output of a function or the closure in computer programming
job (general function) = A general description of function: a mathematical function, a job in a company, in a work, routine, etc.
band = a band called f(x)

job and function_disambiguition both have the meaning for general description ???!!!

The term job may refer to: a job (biology), explaining why the features remain by selecting a function (computer science), or routine, is part of the code within a large program, to accomplish a specific task and function (engineering), related to a specific feature of the system and function (language) In linguistics, a method for achieving a goal using language is a function (mathematics), which is an abstract entity that is associated with an input to a compatible output according to some rules.
